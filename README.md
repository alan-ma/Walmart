# Walmart
An economics project by Yifei Zhang and Alan Ma.
<br>
This is an analysis on whether or not small towns should accept a new Walmart store. The report looks at social, economic, and environmental aspects, and explains how Walmart will affect the major stakeholders.
<br>
Since this was created rather quickly for a school project, the mobile design was not taken into account (adaptive design? what?).
<br>
Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery.
